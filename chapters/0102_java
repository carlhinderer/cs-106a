- von Neumann architecture = programs and data can be represented in a similar way
                               in the same internal memory



- Generations of Early Computing

    First Generation = vacuum tubes (Ananasoff-Barry, 1939)
    Second Generation = transistors (invented in 1947, first computer is IBM 7070, 1958)
    Third Generation = integrated circuits (chips) photographically imprinted onto silicon wafers
                          (invented in 1959, first computer is IBM 360, 1964)
    Fourth Generation = microprocessors (invented in 1975)



- Java Compilation

    Classic compilation =
      1. Compile source file into object file
      2. Link object file with other object files to create executable

        source_file -> compiler -> object_file -> linker -> executable_file
                                   object_file ->


    Java compilation = JVM runs intermediate byte code, but the JVM's jitter will often compile
                         chunks of code before running them

                     = intermediate code is stored in 'class files' and linked class files are 
                         grouped together into a 'JAR archive'

        source_file -> java_compiler -> class_file -> linker -> JAR archive -> JVM
                                        class_file



- History of OOP

    - SIMULA (Scandanavians Dahl, Myhrhaug, and Nygaard, early 1960s)
    - Smalltalk (Xerox PARC, late 1970s)
    - C (Dennis Ritchie, Bell Labs, 1970)
    - C++ (Bjarne Stroustrup, Bell Labs, early 1980s)
    - Java (James Gosling, Sun Microsystems, 1991)



- History of the web

    - Hypertext is described by Ted Nelson (1965)
    - ARPANET (1969)
    - WWW is described by Tim Berners-Lee (CERN, 1989)
    - First browser is created (CERN, 1991)
    - Mosaic browser is released (National Center for Supercomputing Applications, 1993)
    - 500 web servers in 1993, 35 million web servers in 2003



- First Program

    /*
     * File: Add2Integers.java
     */

    import acm.program.*;

    public class Add2Integers extends ConsoleProgram {
        public void run() {
            println("This program adds 2 integers.");
            int n1 = readInt("Enter n1: ");
            int n2 = readInt("Enter n2: ");
            int total = n1 + n2;
            println("The total is " + total + ".");
        }
    }



- Principles of OOP

    - Object contains both state and behavior

    - Calling a method is passing a message to a receiver object
    
        receiver.name(arguments)
